This program converts a font in a format understood by FreeType into a C
structure definition for a tFont that can be used by the GrStringDraw()
function.  FreeType can understand TrueType, OpenType, Type 1, and many other
font formats.  See http://www.freetype.org for details on the features and
capabilities of FreeType.

The command line arguments to the program are as follows:

  -b             This indicates that the font is a bold face font.  This only
                 affects the name of the structure and the name of the file
                 that is produced.

  -f <filename>  This specifies the file name fragment used to construct the
                 name of the output file name.  Typically, this will be an
                 indicator of the font style, and is placed into a comment
                 within the output file as the style of the font.

  -i             This indicates that the font is an italic face font.  This
                 only affects the name of the structure and the name of the
                 file that is produced.

  -s <size>      This specifies the size (height) of the font to be rendered in
                 points (which is equivalent to pixels).  Due to the imprecise
                 nature of rendering a font down to black and white (without
                 any aliasing), it is possible that the resulting font data
                 will be slightly larger or smaller that this size.

So, for example, the following would render a Computer Modern small-caps font
at 24 point:

    ftrasterize -f cmsc -s 24 cmcsc10.pfb

The output will be written to fontcmsc24.c and contain a definition for
g_sFontCmsc24.
